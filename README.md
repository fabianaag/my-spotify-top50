# Bogota Seasons

As a part of the [Visual Analytics course](http://johnguerra.co/classes/visual_analytics_fall_2017) at Universidad de los Andes,
I have taken my top 50 artists from Spotify using its [API endpoint](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-users-top-artists-and-tracks/) 
and I made a graph out of it connecting artists that share at least one music genre. Later, I also took advantage of 
[related artists endpoint](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-related-artists/) to make further connections.

The visualization was made with [d3 v4](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki) using the [force layout](https://github.com/d3/d3-force)

You can see the demo running [here](https://ss1993.github.io/my-spotify-top50/).

I took advantage of d3 forceX method to distribute the graph's nodes based on their genre.

The legend was made using the [d3 legend](http://d3-legend.susielu.com) library.
